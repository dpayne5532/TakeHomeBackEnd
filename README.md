# First Major Hurdle - https for the server! 

Apple doesn't allow network calls to http, and will most likely block a server with a self signed certificate. For my use case, I decided to deploy my server on fly.io. I have it up and running with the secure protocol! While I had given myself most of today to acommplish that, I find myself with more time to add a little more pizzaz to the front end!
